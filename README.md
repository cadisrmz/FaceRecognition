## Important 
For Every Persone you collect his picture make it in one folder by the name of the persone that u want track in the video

## How I Can Use It 
There Is 2 Main file in this :
  ```
  Face.py
  trainner.py
  ```

for Face.py in the line 19:
  ```
  this line if you want use the input of the video is camera live steam 
  put this code :
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
  And if you wnat an other video just replace the argument in cap 
  like this:
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture("myVideo.mp4")
  ```
and for trainner.py in the line 15 :
```
  mainDir is the Direction of the Current file in the System
  mainDir is Like this '/home/exemple/Desktop'
  and the second argument is the direction of the piucture file
  change it if you want change the direction
  ```
